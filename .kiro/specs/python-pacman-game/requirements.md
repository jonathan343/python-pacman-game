# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This specification outlines the requirements for a Python-based Pacman game designed as a demo application. The game will feature classic Pacman gameplay mechanics including maze navigation, dot collection, ghost AI, and power pellets, implemented using Python and Pygame. The focus is on creating an engaging and visually appealing game that demonstrates solid game development principles while remaining manageable in scope.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a player, I want to control Pacman through a maze using keyboard input, so that I can navigate and collect dots.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the player presses arrow keys THEN Pacman SHALL move in the corresponding direction
2. WHEN Pacman encounters a wall THEN the system SHALL prevent movement in that direction
3. WHEN Pacman moves through a tunnel THEN the system SHALL wrap Pacman to the opposite side of the maze
4. WHEN Pacman changes direction THEN the system SHALL smoothly animate the direction change

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a player, I want to collect dots and earn points, so that I can progress through the game and achieve high scores.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN Pacman moves over a dot THEN the system SHALL remove the dot and increase the score by 10 points
2. WHEN Pacman collects a power pellet THEN the system SHALL remove the pellet and increase the score by 50 points
3. WHEN all dots are collected THEN the system SHALL advance to the next level
4. WHEN the score increases THEN the system SHALL update the score display in real-time

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a player, I want to interact with ghosts that chase me, so that the game provides challenge and excitement.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the game starts THEN the system SHALL spawn four ghosts with different AI behaviors
2. WHEN ghosts are in normal mode THEN they SHALL actively pursue Pacman using pathfinding algorithms
3. WHEN Pacman collects a power pellet THEN ghosts SHALL enter frightened mode for 10 seconds
4. WHEN ghosts are frightened THEN they SHALL flee from Pacman and become edible

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a player, I want to eat frightened ghosts for bonus points, so that power pellets provide strategic value.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN Pacman touches a frightened ghost THEN the system SHALL remove the ghost temporarily and award 200 points
2. WHEN a ghost is eaten THEN the system SHALL respawn the ghost at the ghost house after 3 seconds
3. WHEN multiple ghosts are eaten during one power pellet THEN the system SHALL multiply the points (200, 400, 800, 1600)
4. WHEN the frightened timer expires THEN ghosts SHALL return to normal chase mode

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a player, I want to lose lives when caught by ghosts, so that the game has consequences and tension.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN Pacman touches a normal ghost THEN the system SHALL reduce lives by one and reset positions
2. WHEN lives reach zero THEN the system SHALL trigger game over state
3. WHEN a life is lost THEN the system SHALL display the remaining lives count
4. WHEN the game resets after losing a life THEN Pacman and ghosts SHALL return to starting positions

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a player, I want to see a visually appealing game with smooth animations, so that the experience is engaging and polished.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the game runs THEN the system SHALL maintain 60 FPS performance
2. WHEN characters move THEN the system SHALL display smooth sprite animations
3. WHEN power pellets are active THEN the system SHALL show visual indicators (flashing ghosts)
4. WHEN the game state changes THEN the system SHALL provide appropriate visual feedback

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a player, I want to track my progress with score and level displays, so that I can measure my performance.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the game starts THEN the system SHALL display current score, lives, and level
2. WHEN the score changes THEN the system SHALL update the display immediately
3. WHEN a level is completed THEN the system SHALL increment the level counter
4. WHEN the game ends THEN the system SHALL display the final score

### Requirement 8

**User Story:** As a player, I want basic game states (start, playing, game over), so that I have a complete game experience.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the application launches THEN the system SHALL display a start screen
2. WHEN the player starts a new game THEN the system SHALL initialize the game state
3. WHEN the game ends THEN the system SHALL display a game over screen with final score
4. WHEN on the game over screen THEN the system SHALL allow the player to restart the game
